    abstract = { This study investigates the role of visual framing in shaping public perceptions of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests through an online experiment, informed by news value and protest paradigm theory. It specifically examines the effects of conflict versus solidarity visual frames on audience reactions when paired with textual framing of protest goals. Results indicate that solidarity visuals significantly decrease negative perceptions about protesters compared to conflict visuals, increase positive affect, and boost engagement intentions. Furthermore, the interaction between visual and textual framing demonstrates that “defund” and “reform” messages paired with solidarity visuals effectively reduce negative perceptions. These findings underscore the impact of visual elements in news coverage, highlighting the need for ethical considerations in visual journalism and suggesting that such framing can significantly influence audience attitudes and engagement with social issues. }

    abstract = { Message frames have been found to influence relevant issue attitudes by influencing the weight of issue considerations emphasized in the message. As such message frames often originate from advocacy interest groups, this study investigates differences in the framing effects of advocacy groups, depending on whether the message fits readers’ expectations for the communicators’ issue position (expected advocacy) or not (unexpected advocacy). Across two issue topics, findings suggest that unexpected advocacy significantly influenced readers’ perceived belief importance, which in turn influenced issue attitudes, whereas the same mediated path of framing effects was not supported in the case of expected advocacy. }

    This study investigates the psychological mechanisms underlying people’s sharing of COVID-19 information within their strong-tie networks and weak-tie networks.
    Methods
    A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March and April 2020 (N = 609 Chinese adults). Measures included emotions and behavioral beliefs about COVID-19 information sharing, risk perceptions, and COVID-19 information acquisition and sharing behaviors. Multiple linear regression was performed to examine the psychological predictors of COVID-19 information sharing.
    Results
    People were more likely to share COVID-19 information within their strong-tie networks when they experienced more negative emotions (β = .09, p = .01) and had stronger beliefs that information sharing would promote disease prevention (β = .12, p = .004). By comparison, negative emotions were the only significant predictor of COVID-19 information sharing (β = .12, p = .002) within weak-tie networks (β = .04, p = .31 for beliefs about sharing).
    Conclusion
    People may share COVID-19 information within weak-tie networks to cope with negative emotions regardless of whether they perceive information sharing as beneficial to disease prevention.
    Innovation
    Health educators should raise people’s awareness of the psychological motivators of COVID-19 information sharing to create a healthy information environment for disease prevention.}

A U.S. online sample of 970 adolescents and 1776 young adults susceptible to cannabis use were recruited from Qualtrics in summer 2022. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of the 3 (CWLs: none vs. textual vs. pictorial) by 3 (comments: none vs. anti-cannabis vs. pro-cannabis) conditions in an online experiment. Participants were exposed to three online marketing posts promoting marijuana edibles (randomly selected from a large pool, N = 1260), each with either no warning label, a textual warning, or a pictorial warning (text and picture), and with either five comments (pro- or anti-cannabis in valence) or none. Results showed that among adolescents, pro-cannabis comments increased product appeal (vs. anti-cannabis comments: b = 0.18, p = .025; vs. no comments: b = 0.21, p = .021), and did so more than young adults.

    abstract = { To examine the effects of numerical evidence and message framing in communicating vaccine efficacy information about infectious diseases, an online experiment presented to U.S. adults different versions of a vaccination promotional message that vary by numerical vaccine efficacy evidence: (low efficacy rate: 60\% vs. high efficacy rate: 95\%), outcome framing (preventing disease-related infection vs. preventing disease-related severe illness), and gain vs. loss framing, using a factorial between-subjects design. While there was no significant interaction between numerical vaccine efficacy evidence and message framing, findings showed that a higher vaccine efficacy rate increased positive beliefs about vaccination and outcome framing emphasizing infection prevention increased message processing fluency. Given that infectious diseases pose higher risks for severe illness among older adults, follow-up analyses by age showed that only younger adults were sensitive to message framing where outcome framing emphasizing infection prevention increased processing fluency. }

  abstract  = {Background: Despite the increasing popularity of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, little is known about which types of mHealth system engagement might affect the maintenance of antiretroviral therapy among people with HIV and substance use disorders. Objective: This study aimed to use longitudinal and detailed system logs and weekly survey data to test a mediation model, where mHealth engagement indicators were treated as predictors, substance use and confidence in HIV management were treated as joint mediators, and antiretroviral therapy adherence was treated as the outcome. We further distinguished the initiation and intensity of system engagement by mode (expression vs reception) and by communication levels (intraindividual vs dyadic vs network). Methods: Tailored for people with HIV living with substance use disorders, the mHealth app was distributed among 208 participants aged >18 years from 2 US health clinics. Supervised by medical professionals, participants received weekly surveys through the app to report their health status and medication adherence data. System use was passively collected through the app, operationalized as transformed click-level data, aggregated weekly, and connected to survey responses with a 7-day lagged window. Using the weekly check-in record provided by participants as the unit of analysis (N=681), linear regression and structure equation models with cluster-robust SEs were used for analyses, controlling within-person autocorrelation and group-level error correlations. Racial groups were examined as moderators in the structure equation models. Results: We found that (1) intensity, not initiation, of system use; (2) dyadic message expression and reception; and (3) network expression positively predicted medication adherence through joint mediators (substance use and confidence in HIV management). However, intraindividual reception (ie, rereading saved entries for personal motivation) negatively predicts medication adherence through joint mediators. We also found Black participants have distinct usage patterns, suggesting the need to tailor mHealth interventions for this subgroup. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of considering the intensity of system engagement, rather than initiation alone, when designing mHealth interventions for people with HIV and tailoring these systems to Black communities.},

This study examines the perceived trust of different COVID-19 information sources (health professionals, academic institutions, government agencies, news media, social media, family, and friends) and sharing of COVID-19 information in China. Specifically, it investigates how beliefs about sharing and emotions mediate the effects of perceived source trust on source-specific information sharing intentions. Results suggest that health professionals, academic institutions, and government agencies are trusted sources of information and that people share information from these sources because they think doing so will increase disease awareness and promote disease prevention. People may also choose to share COVID-19 information from news media, social media, and family as they cope with anxiety, anger, and fear. Taken together, a better understanding of the distinct psychological mechanisms underlying health information sharing from different sources can help contribute to more effective sharing of information about COVID-19 prevention and to manage negative emotion contagion during the pandemic. }

Americans were also more likely to use mediated communication as their primary sources of health information while Chinese people favored interpersonal sources.

For example, many messages regarding COVID-19 vaccines featured numerical vaccine efficacy rates in preventing infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. While the relationship between disease risk perceptions and fear has been well established, we know less about the psychological factors involved in communicating vaccine efficacy information, such as response efficacy perceptions and hope. This study examines the effects of numerical vaccine efficacy information and message framing on vaccination intentions and their relationship to perceived response efficacy and hope, using a fictitious infectious disease similar to COVID-19. Findings suggest that communicating a high efficacy rate of the vaccine in preventing severe illness increased perceived response efficacy, which in turn boosted vaccination intention directly and indirectly through increasing hope. Also, fear about the virus was positively associated with hope about the vaccine. Implications of using response efficacy information and hope appeals in health communication and vaccination promotion are discussed. }

This study employs an online survey experiment (N = 551 U.S. adults) to examine the impact of war metaphors compared to non-metaphorical literal frames and fire metaphors (e.g. “the pandemic is a wildfire”). War metaphors exhibited little advantage over literal frames across a variety of desirable outcomes (i.e. the adoption of pro-health behaviors against COVID-19, perceived solidarity and collective responsibility to curb the pandemic, and intentions to discuss and share the health news with others). However, this study revealed some benefits of war metaphors over fire metaphors. Compared with fire metaphors, health news featuring war metaphors increased both positive emotions and perceived threats of COVID-19, which in turn promoted pro-health behaviors against COVID-19 and perceived solidarity to cope with the public health crisis. Moreover, positive emotions in response to war metaphors also indirectly encouraged the retransmission of science-based COVID-19 health news. This study thus showcased the benefits and limitations of war metaphors and revealed the mediating roles of perceived threats and positive emotions in explaining war metaphorical framing effects. Implications of using war and fire metaphors for communicating about public health crises are also discussed. }

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
